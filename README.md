| Search | <img src="assets/search_dark_gif.gif" alt="Search screen preview" width="200" /> |

| Detail | <img src="assets/detail_dark_gif.gif" alt="Detail screen preview" width="200" /> |

You may install and try to understand the code better, but make sure you provide your own Tmdb api
key for data to show up.
You should add your missing api key in directory `/utils/ApiKey.kt`.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

`Jetpack Compose` is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It enables you to quickly
bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

Understanding to implement own `Theme` `Shape` `Typography` `Color` has became bit easier by
referring to lot of official jetpack compose samples which are available in GitHub.

Best of all we got to do this in `Kotlin` way. Excited and long way to go from here.
