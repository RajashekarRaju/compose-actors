# Compose Actors

## :scroll: Description

Android app built with `Jetpack Compose`. This app contains an overview screen that displays a list
of cats, and a detail screen showing each cat's details.

`Jetpack Compose` is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It enables you to quickly
bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

`Jetpack Compose` will ease the implementing animations faster with less code. Check below previews.
I have made use of `AnimatedVisibility` in many places in app.

App navigation is built with `Compose` too which eliminates the previous way of using `Navigation`
Component with `xml` graph. This made development faster also passing args and changing
destinations.

Understanding to implement own `Theme` `Shape` `Typography` `Color` has became bit easier by
referring to lot of official jetpack compose samples which are available in GitHub.

Best of all we got to do this in `Kotlin` way. Excited and long way to go from here.
